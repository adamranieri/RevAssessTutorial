# What is RevAssess?
RevAssess is a platform to assign software **exercises** to associates. An exercise is a self-contained software project.

## Is an exercise a coding challenge?
A RevAssess exercise is not a typical coding challenge. A coding challenge might ask you to implement a few methods or create a data structure.
Exercises require you to implement portions of actual software projects. 

### Examples
- Create a REST API for a specific entity
- Implement a DAO interface
- Debug and fix a broken service class

## DO's and DON'Ts
- *DO* use your notes, past code or Google for problems you run into. RevAssess is an open book asssesment. 
- *DO* reach out to your trainer if you have a technial issue with RevAssess. For example, project.zip will not download.
- *DO* use your own cloud resources like SQL databases, S3 etc... Being a software developer involves knowing how to commission and use all your tools.
- *DO* use whatever software will help you achieve the task. I.E. if you need to add a dependency or test via Postman.
---
- *DON'T* store sensitive information in your code. (Use environment variables or configuration files outside the project)
- *DON'T* remove/edit the RevAssessConfig.json or TestResults.json files 
- *DON'T* ask each other or your trainer for help. The goal is to test your ability to independently problem solve.
